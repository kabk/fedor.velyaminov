 “All art is quite useless.” 
                - Oscar Wilde
<br>

</div>


<p>
From the beginning of Western civilization aesthetic theory has been developed, enriched and motivated by thinkers, philosophers, and artists. They have seen the experience of beauty as an appeal to the sublime. Plato, writing in Athens in the fourth century BC, argued that beauty is the sign of another and higher order. “Beholding beauty with the eye of the mind”, he wrote, “you will be able to nourish true virtue and become the friend of God.” (Plato, Symposium) . At any time before twenty century if you asked educated people to describe the aim of poetry, art or music, they  Beauty remained a value, as important as truth and goodness. Then in 20th century aesthetics increasingly stopped being important and art has become in many cases a pure, self-oriented originality achieved by whatever moral costs it takes. Anything has a right to be called an art today, whereas art has an obvious impact on individual. Art does not express the divine no longer, but simply follows massive “commune” often for a sake of self advertisement and enrichment. We experience a big pressure of an image imposed by media and pop culture that makes us rethink and change in certain way not just our physical surroundings, but our acts values, music, manners, even language becoming progressively poorer and more callous. 
</p>
<p>
I am certain that beauty is not just a subjective thing, but an objective universal need, indeed interpreted differently by every individual, yet has some characteristics that are inherent for human commonly   (An idea explored further in chapter 2). 
</p>
<p>
The great artists of the past were aware that human life is full of chaos and suffering. But they believed that the remedy for the bitter reality could be found in art. The genuine work of art brings consolation in sorrow and assertion in joy. It shows human life to be worthwhile. Many modern artists have become weary of this sacred task. The randomness of modern life, they think, cannot be redeemed by art. Instead it should be displayed. Of course an ancestor of today’s observed conceptual arts could be rightly and submitted it for an exhibition. His gesture was satirical, designed to mock the world of art and the snobberies that go with a confirmation that anything can be art like a can of excrement (Piero Manzoni: Artist’s Shit, 1961) or Images like by Andres Serrano’s Piss Christ (1987) and Robert Mapplethorpe’s Jim and Tom, Sausalito (1977) (which showed one man urinating into another man’s mouth) even a pile of bricks by Carl Andre proudly referred as an art piece. 
</p>
<p>
In such cases, art does not have any sacred status, neither attempts to rise us higher, nor conveys moral or spiritual values, instead It becomes a human gesture among others; as meaningful as a laugh or a shout. Art used to be a cult of beauty in the past, nowadays it often seem to encourage cult of ugliness instead.’ (Roger Scruton, Beauty matters) Notice how people who look for beauty in art seem to be just out of touch with modern realities. Nevertheless, the art world understandably is a highly competitive place, and artists need any edge they can get, including a shock value to be recognized. But what is shocking first time round is boring and vacuous when repeated. 


</p>
<p>
In other hand getting back to Duchamp’s Urinal it has never meant to be beautiful. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t stimulate our imagination. Stimulate the imagination could be called a key to what art seeks to do nowadays. Duchamp felt that art had become too interested in technique. His reason for making an artwork was a denial of all of the things that people saw in art previously in order to explore a central question of art that in his opinion was laying somewhere else than beauty, rarity and skill. Duchamp himself had no idea how influential the discovery he had stumbled upon would become – a statement that a work of art is a work of art because we think of it as such. ‘He took an ordinary article of life, placed it so that its useful significance disappeared under the new title and point of view - created a new thought for that object.' The Blind Man, New York, no.2, May 1917, p.5.)
</p>
<p>
A defender of conceptual art may argue that an idea of certain artwork can be beautiful and there is nothing wrong in perceiving conceptual art from this perspective. It allows people to see the world in which they are living in presence, an abstract world that isn’t ideal, but the world as it is, some better place but of the here and now that teaches how to be and leave more at ease with it.

</p>
<p>
But to take a look at an example of Eugene Delacroix’s bed  (Un Lit Defait, 1827) , It displays the artist’s bed in all its disorder. He too is bringing up the world as it is with all its vanity and personal emotional chaos. But the bed is transformed by the creative act to become – a symbol of the human condition and one which makes a bond between the artist and us. It becomes suddenly much more than a depiction of every day life. Delacroix says, “See how these sweat-stained sheets record the troubled dreams, the tormented energy of the person who has left them and how the light picks them out as if they are still animated by the sleeper.” 
Coceptual art is often an idea , a beautiful concept But having an idea does not mean it’s a work of art. A statesman or a scientist could come up with a beautiful idea but it doe not make them an artists. 

</p>
<p>
Some people describe Tracey Emin’s bed in that way. Bet the key of the separation between the works of art as In examples of Delacroix and Tracey Emin is that one makes ugliness beautiful and the other shares the ugliness that it shows. To me, the biggest and, perhaps the most essential difference lies upon this statement. 
</p>
<p>
Breakfast with Frost, BBC 1999
</p>
<p>
David Frost: “What is it that makes that art rather than just a rumpled bed?”
</p>
<p>
Tracey Emin: “The first thing that makes it art is that I say that it is.”
</p>
<p>
Interviewer: “You say that is..
</p>
<p>
Emin: “I say that it is.”
</p>
<p>
Frost: “The second thing is that the Tate says that it is….But what do you want the viewer, the visitor to the gallery to say? Do you want…. You don’t want them to say, ‘I think that’s beautiful.’”
</p>
<p>
Emin: “No, no one’s actually said that, only me.”
</p>
<p>
Frost: “You think it’s beautiful?”
</p>
<p>
Emin: “Yeah…. I do, otherwise I wouldn’t have showed it.”

</p>
<p>
Doubtlessly Emin’s work makes no attempt to transform the raw material of an idea but shares one sordid reality among others – Literal translation of modern life that does not pursuit to convey any neither moral nor social values.  
</p>
<p>
“The art of today shows us the world as it is – the here and now and all its imperfections. But is the result really art. Surely something is not a work of art simply because it offers a slice of reality.” (Roger Scruton, Beauty matters) Tracey Emin’s bed is a perfect example of “intellectually and morally corrupt” art piece. If you walked past on a street and you saw that bed like that just lying there you would probably walk on. But, of course, if you saw even just the torso of the Apollo Belvedere lying in a skip you would be arrested by it. 
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately In today’s democratic culture people often think it is threatening to judge another person’s taste. Some are even offended by the suggestion that there is a difference between good and bad taste or that it matters what you look at or read or listen to. But this doesn’t help anybody in the end, the reality is that There are standards of beauty which have a firm base in human nature and by understanding these standards the genuine work of art can be created. 
</p>
<p>
“All art is absolutely useless”, wrote Oscar Wilde. This remark was intended as accolade for art that has a value higher than usefulness. People need useless things just as much as and even more than they need things for their use. Clear example of it is worship or a friendship. These things are absolutely useless. And the same applies for art and beauty.
</p>
<p>
“Our consumer society puts usefulness first and beauty is no better than a side effect. Since art is useless it doesn’t matter what you read, what you look at, what you listen to. We are concurred by messages on every side, titillated, tempted by appetite. And that is one reason why beauty is disappearing from our world. In our culture today the advert is more important than the work of art and art works often try to capture our attention as adverts do.” (Roger Scruton, Beauty matters) The cynical assessment is that often contemporary art does not forge meaningful associations, but promotes entertainment and profit.’ (Cynthia Freeland - But is it Art , p34 , Paradigms and purposes) An example that comes to mind first is a Damien Hirst’s acknowledged bejeweled platinum skull (“For the Love of God” [2007]) “sparkling” with its “controversy” or macabre high-tech exhibits of dead sharks, sliced cows, or lambs in vitrines of formaldehyde. It is easy to imagine how Hirst’s tableaux of rotting meat (complete with maggots) “helped” the food business—but fame works in inscrutable ways.. Like adverts today’s works of art often aim to create a brand even when it has no product to sell, it sells itself.
</p>
<p>
My assessment of art may seem very conservative and even hypocritical especially since I myself work in the field of progressive contemporary graphic design, but it must be stressed that to my personal view there is clear separation between art and design. Artists and designers both create visual compositions using a shared knowledge base, but their reasons for doing so are entirely different.
</p>
<p>
 It serves people in two different ways and sometimes what is comforts the design is not sufficient for the art (and other way around). One of the reasons I have chosen my path in art to be graphic design is its frankness, it does ultimately appears to be tied together with trade and commerce and yet it does makes the world aesthetically attractive and fills it up with beautiful physical surroundings. Both art and design needs creativity and “creativity is about sharing. It is a call to others to see the world as the artist sees it… That’s why beauty can be found often in the naive art of children… Something of the child’s pure delight in creation survives in every true work of art… But creativity is not enough and the skill of the true artist is to show the real in the light of the ideal and so (Roger Scruton, Beauty matters) 
</p>
<p>
At the turn of 20th century architects, like artists, began to impatient with beauty and to put utility in its place. The American architect Louis Sullivan expressed the credo of the modernists when he said that “form follows function.” In other words, stop thinking about the way a building looks and think instead about what it does. I would like to use my personal experience to describe how Sullivan’s doctrine could be interpreted to justify a crime against architecture. I grew up in Moscow close to suburbs abundant with modern concrete architecture. The main idea of such architecture was the utility, in order to settle increasingly growing population and relocate people from communal houses. In the period of 1960s to 1980s Moscow has undergone a mass building. To fulfill an assignment rapidly and save money at the same time, the cheapest materials were used let alone any decoration or aesthetic component. As the result we may see today people simply do not want to live in buildings and concrete surroundings like that and trying to escape from it or move away, the pure utility with no regard to human needs can not be justified by any doctrine.
</p>
<p>
This returns me to Oscar Wilde’s remark that all art is absolutely useless. “Put usefulness first and you lose it. Put beauty first and what you do will be useful forever… It turns out that nothing is more useful than the useless. Ornaments in architecture liberate us from the tyranny of the useful and satisfy our need for harmony. In a way They remind us that we have more than practical needs. We are not just governed by animal appetites, like eating and sleeping. We have spiritual and moral needs too and if those needs go unsatisfied, so do we.”(Roger Scruton, Beauty matters)

<h2>chapter two</h2>
<h3>introduction</h3>

<p>
This chapter is intended to reveal and investigate the objective view on beauty and aesthetics that claims a fact that beauty contained in the object, and that evaluation of beauty have objective validity.
In the Greater Hippias, Plato* ascribes to Socrates the viewpoint that one cannot appropriately separate between beautiful and ugly objects without knowing what beauty is. On the other hand, in the Symposium, Plato asserts that “knowledge of beauty begins with direct experience of particular cases and knowledge of the abstract form of beauty is the highest and final stage, distilled from everyday experience.”
Throughout the centuries Plato’s ideas has been encouraging philosophers, artists, critics, and scientists to be reflecting upon the nature of beauty throughout the centuries. In this chapter I tried to include the most influential works concerning a field of aesthetic theory.  Attempts to describe beauty can be divided into two main categories: theories that reviews beauty as a type of order and theories that reviews beauty as a type of pleasure. I would like to refer to these two groups next.

</p>
<h3>Beauty is an order</h3>
<p>
The Pythagoreans* tried to prove that beauty is an expression of balanced harmonious, mathematical interactions such as the golden section whereas ugliness is the manifestation of disorder absent of rational logical proportions. For them the beauty was considered an objective expression of universal truth. The ancient Egyptians were perhaps the first to introduce the golden section in the design of the Pyramids, but it was Pythagoras * who was first to present its mathematical formulation.
</p>
<p>
Pythagorean ideas were later quite popularized and followed by many. Plato writes in Philebus that beauty is established and consists of proportions. Aristotle * in Poetics* linked aesthetics with higher order and size well as symmetry and definiteness in Metaphysics*. St. Augustine of Hippo* asserts that beauty is related and based on numbers (De libero arbitrio). Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz * was ascribing beauty a cryptic, sensuous expression of mathematical qualities (Principles of Nature and Grace Based on Reason, 1714), William Hogarth * designated elements of beauty pertinent in art (The Analysis of Beauty, 1753). Many other authors expressed similar views.
Western philosophy sympathized the Pythagorean concepts of beauty because of two significant reasons: The relation between beauty and order and the practice suggested that the parts of a beautiful object are complement each other, and well composed, oriented in space, and create a unified whole was tempting to the rational mind. This perspective provokes the notion of union in diversity: Beauty consists of complexity that is allied by order. Taking into account the fact that order is the key notion for accepting beauty, rises a question if there are unifying conditions of beauty that relate to all examples of beautiful objects, in the same manner that the laws of nature affects physical laws.

</p>
<p>
One of the most influential philosophers who had contributed to aesthetic investigation was Alexander Baumgarten*. He suggested an establishment of a new science, called aesthetics. Baumgarten argued that beauty has a technical side, alike the laws nature it could be revealed by methodical investigations based on experience. Baumgarten was not popular enough among philosophers, however many mathematicians and psychologists influenced his views. In the field of psychology, the exploration of beauty is mainly referred to Gestalt theory and experimental aesthetics. Max Wertheimer * and Kurt Koffka* researched spatial-visual form of perceived objects. According to these theorists, the objects that make up our environment, perceived by the senses not as separate entities, but as an organized form. (1) Koffka founded experimental aesthetics and introduced it into psychology. 
</p>
<p>
In the mathematical realm one of the most important figures is considered D. Birkhoff *, He came up with a formula that encapsulated his insights into aesthetic value and described his theory. Birkhoff's formula and its potential applications—to such creations as vases, architectural designs, melodies, and even poetry (2) in order to formulate a concept of beauty. Birkhoff's concluded that the pleasure originated from any artwork or beautiful object depends on two variables: order (O), which stands for the unity of the object, and complexity (C), or the diversity expressed by the object. At the core of his theory was a formula: M = O/C. In other words, Birkhoff put a high aesthetic value on orderliness and a low one on complexity. In his view, beauty increases as complexity decreases.(3)
formula for aesthetic measure could be applied to isolated polygonal figures. In this case, O = V+ E + R + HV – F, where V is vertical symmetry, E is equilibrium, R is rotational symmetry, HV is the relation of the polygon to a horizontal-vertical network, and F is a general negative factor (unsatisfactory form). C is the number of distinct straight lines containing at least one side of the polygon.

</p>
<p>
Daniel E. Berlyne *, had a significant impact on experimental aesthetics in the twentieth century, he introduced an idea of “happy medium” in a psychological practice. He describes the pleasure obtained by perceiving beauty and good art as a reduction of excitation. Complex forms causes arousal in tension, and subsequently, when the perceived whole is observed, tension is reduced. According to his theory, researches tend to confirm that certain medium degree of complexity arouses most joyful effect and that extreme amounts of simplicity or complexity are distasteful. (Conflict, Arousal, and Curiosity, 1960).
</p>
<p>
However, one of the most respected aesthetic philosophers of the twentieth century Monroe C. Beardsley * did not share sufficiently the idea of rendering beauty or “fine” art in terms of a happy medium or an average. He argues that the association of complexity with disorder fails to explain the fact that complexity is a relevant soil for admire, and that the degree of informative value is not high enough to produce the aesthetic evaluation of an object. Beardsley maintains that beauty is a type of order, but argues that the aesthetic perception inspired by information theory leads to absurd. Aesthetic order, according to Beardsley, avoids mechanical framing and manifests freedom, diversity, and uniqueness. 
</p>
<p>
Heinrich Wölfflin*, an acknowledged art historian, classifies good art as an life form in which nothing could be replaced or moved from its place, but in which all must remain as it is (Principles of Art History, 1915). Ruth Lorand, although, argues that the idea of an organic unity leaves with no regard, in most of its variations, the quantitative feature of beauty. Some objects are more beautiful than others, and ultimate beauty of the kind observed by Wölfflin and others is barely possible. Aesthetic order, according to Lorand, highly unpredictable, and, paradoxically, an order without laws.
</p>
<p>
The terminology of organic form or an organic whole proposes that beauty represent a non-mechanical order and includes inner forces or structures. In an organic form the whole maintains the isolation of the parts, and the various parts are interdependent. Plato was the first to suggest a notion of art as an organic form* in connection with literary works of art. 
</p>
<p>
<h3>Beauty is a pleasure</h3>
</p>
<p>
The direct connection between beauty and emotion, and the complexities involved in beauty definition as a quality of the object, have given a base to the idea that beauty is not a quality of the object, but instead an emotion suggested by the object. St. Augustine wonders whether an object is aesthetically attractive because it pleases or pleases because it is aesthetically attractive, in a work  De vera religione  he reveals that the object pleases because it is aesthetically attractive. According to St. Augustine beauty is the type of pleasure and not identical with it .
</p>
<p>
Empiricists of the eighteenth century, considered taste, to be a capacity for valuing beauty. Francis Hutcheson* describes beauty as a cause of pleasure that specifies not only qualities discovered in the object, but also the character of the viewer's aesthetical sense (5). Joseph Addison* writes that possibly there is no genuine beauty, only certain variations of matter that the mind considers beautiful (6). Thomas Reid* In his Essays (5), ascribes an occult features to beauty: we are aware how it affects our senses, but not what it is in itself. 
</p>
<p>
Immanuel Kant is considered the most significant figure in modern philosophy together with influential Scottish philosopher David Hume both men spoke of aesthetics in terms of ‘taste’, to be an ability to perceive quality in an artwork. 
</p>
<p>
‘Taste’ might seem completely subjective—we all know the saying ‘there’s no account for taste’. Some people have favourite colours and desserts, just as they prefer certain kinds of automobiles or furniture. Isn’t art just like this? Perhaps you prefer Dickens and Fassbinder, while I prefer Stephen King and Austin Powers; how can you prove that your taste is better than mine? Hume and Kant both struggled with this problem. Both men believed that some works of art really are better than others, and that some people have better taste. 
(Cynthia Freeland - But is it Art , taste and beauty, p9)

</p>
<p>
Hume and Kant were dealing with the same problems but had different approaches in order to prove their theories. In influential essay Standard of Taste (1757), Hume argues that different viewers often equally appreciating the beauty of the same object. He likewise highlighted education and experience: men of taste obtain certain capabilities that lead to agreement about certain authors or artworks to be finest. Such people, he felt, finally will reach consensus, and in doing so, they estimate a ‘standard of taste’ in universal sense. These experts can define and separate works of high aesthetics value from less valuable ones. Hume stressed men of taste have to be capable to ‘preserve minds free from prejudice’, yet no one shall appreciate immoral attitudes or ‘vicious manners’ in art. Nevertheless nowadays skeptics  tend to criticize the narrowness of this view, saying that Hume’s taste-arbiters only acquired their values through cultural indoctrination.
</p>
<p>
Kant as well argued about judgments of taste he attempted to bond the gap between rationalism and empiricism. His version of beauty in Critique of Judgment (1790) is the first methodical examination of the aesthetic phenomenon in philosophy.  However Kant was concerned mostly with clarifying judgements of Beauty and differentiates between the beautiful and the sublime. Beauty delights through the free play of the mind and understanding and retain the imagination in restful contemplation. The sublime expresses a disharmony between sensual abilities and reason. Therefore, the sensation of the sublime conveys a mental anxiety. Kant describes beauty in relations with irregular kind of pleasure that consists in contradictory features. Kant intended to show that good judgments in aesthetics are concealed in the feature of an artwork itself, not just in our preferences and us. Kant attempted to label our human capabilities in relation to our perception and categorizing of the world around us. There is a complex interaction among our mental abilities including perception, imagination, and intelligence or judgment. Kant believed that in order to accomplish our human purposes and function properly in the world, we marque much of what we sense, often in rather unconscious ways. 
</p>
<p>
“We modern Westerners recognize round flat things out in the world, and we categorize some of these as dinner plates. Then we use them to eat our meals. Similarly, we recognize some things as food and others as potential threats or marriage partners.
It is not easy to say how we categorize things like red roses as beautiful. The beauty of the roses is not out there in the world, as the roundness and flatness are in the plates. If it were, then we would not get into so many disagreements of taste. And yet there is some sort of basis for claiming that the roses are beautiful. After all, there is quite a lot of human agreement that roses are beautiful and that cockroaches are ugly. Hume tried to resolve this problem by saying that judgements of taste are ‘intersubjective’: people with taste tend to agree with each other. Kant believed that judgements of beauty were universal and grounded in the real world, even though they were not actually ‘objective’. How could this be?”
(Cynthia Freeland - But is it Art , taste and beauty, p11)

</p>
<p>
Kant is regarded as well as an ancestor of the modern scientific psychologists who researched judgements of beauty by observing infant preferences for faces, tracking viewers’ eye movements, or involving artists to do magnetic resonance images (MRIs images). Kant concluded that people naturally apply certain concepts to the world to categorize sensory feedbacks that suit a purpose. 
</p>
<p>
For example, when I find a round flat thing in the dish- washer that I recognize as a plate, I put it away in the cupboard with other plates, not in the drawer with spoons. Beautiful objects do not serve ordinary human purposes, as plates and spoons do. A beautiful rose pleases us, but not because we necessarily want to eat it or even pick it for a flower arrangement. Kant’s way of recognizing this was to say that something beautiful has ‘purposiveness without a purpose’. 
(Cynthia Freeland - But is it Art , taste and beauty, p11)

</p>
<p>
Numerous authors after Kant, nevertheless, tended to reject the objective nature of beauty and defined it as principally subjective. Edgar Allan Poe * argued in The Philosophy of Composition * that when people define beauty, they do not imply a quality but an effect—a powerful and pure elevation of the soul. George Santayana * stated that beauty does not relate or belong to an object. It is an reaction to pleasure that is mistakenly regarded as a quality of the object, such as color, composition, or size. In this opinion, beauty is a value that reflects the viewer position, thus is entirely subjective. The inclination to connect beauty to objects and assume other people to practice the similar beauty according to Santayana, a extraordinary psychological sensation that asks for psychological investigation (6).
Although, not all of those who regard beauty in relation to pleasure consider it subjective. Clarence I. Lewis*, for example, views all assessments, including beauty evaluation, as type of empirical information. He states that all types of empirical experiences are relational and they vary evenly on both the qualities of the object in question and the inputs of the contemplating mind. Regarding beauty as a relational quality avoids the subjective-objective conflict and attracts similarities between awareness of beauty and relational perception of other qualities. (7)

</p>
<p>
John Locke* separates between objective and personal qualities. The former are principal qualities liberated of the spectator's apprehension; the last are secondary and tertiary qualities that reflect emotional observations and sensual responses (8). Reacting on this understanding, David W. Prall * holds that beauty is established in pleasurable anxiety and is therefore a tertiary quality that reproduces the spectator's respond to the object's qualities (9). Beauty, as a tertiary value, is most subtle to distinct variations amongst spectators. Personality is also essential in Mary Mothersill's classification of beauty. According to his exploration, an object is beautiful if it origins pleasure by feature of its aesthetic properties. Aesthetic properties are the properties that describe the personality of object and separate it from others. The degree of beauty, Mothersill maintains, demands a consistent theory, since the degree of beauty is the measure of the emotion it origins.
</p>
<h3>Beauty in art</h3>
<p>
</p>
Art was traditionally regarded to be a source of aesthetics; some even claimed that natural beauty is related to artistic beauty. Yet, Plato, divided art and beauty into two independent notions: genuine beauty mirrors truth, whereas art is a misleading imitation of nature. Differently Aristotle, maintains that fine art is beautiful and therefore, the two are inseparable: a fine work of art is a beautiful object. The Aristotelian aesthetic practice was prevalent for eras, but it was the eighteenth century that offered growth to the concept that producing beauty is the vital purpose of art.
<p>
</p>
Kant maintains that fine art is beautiful, yet it varies principally from natural beauty: a good work of art is a depiction of beautiful. A representation could beautiful even if its subject matter is not beautiful. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel* claims that beauty is the crucial point of art, and natural beauty is a echo of artistic beauty (10) In this vision, beauty mirrors intended formation, not random results of blind, ordinary forces. Friedrich von Schiller* connects art with liberty and beauty: we reach at liberty through creative beauty, since it is a product of intended, free choice (11). The contrast between artistic and natural beauty guided Oscar Wilde* to the statement that life and nature replicate art much more than art replicates life or nature. Art is the formation of beauty; life and nature establish its raw materials (12) Benedetto Croce* likewise argues that the notion of natural beauty is a imitative of artistic beauty. Beauty of nature cannot be clarified without one views it as the work of a divine creator. To Croce, beauty is a substitute of intuitive perception and expression, and these refer to the artistic form. The content of the work is beautiful only when shaped into form.
<p>
</p>
Robin G. Collingwood* describes art as an challenge to attain beauty (13) Nevertheless, his standpoint did not increase popularity in the twentieth century. The dominant logical tendency is preferred, it would be perceived straightforward, definable notions and has not been encouraging to the study of the contradictory nature of beauty, its vague logical position, and the infinite arguments over matters of taste. Therefore, beauty has been rejected as a unclear and irrelevant concept and perceived inappropriate to art. Ludwig Wittgenstein* observes in this logical manner that beauty is a strange word that is hardly ever used (14). John A. Passmore argues that there is something doubtful about the idea of beauty, and that artists appear to exist rather well without it. He links beauty with kitsch and bourgeois art .
<p>
</p>
The connotation of beauty with superficiality and relaxing bourgeois existence is contrasting to the radical essence of modern art and the overall atmosphere amongst the two worlds detaching beauty from nowadays art common practice. According to Curt J. Ducasse*, there is no vital connection between art and beauty. Art is an challenge to convey feelings, and artists must be able to produce or express ugliness in their work (15). Nelson Goodman* claimed that many of the best paintings are, in the most literal sense, ugly. Beauty, to Goodman, is a vague and misleading concept, while art is a type of language that has no vital connection with beauty (16). The significant and acknowledged official description of art presented by George Dickie similarly avoids the idea of beauty.
<p>
</p>
Mary Mothersill intensely criticizes the broad abandonment of beauty and its separation from art. She maintains that the concept of beauty is crucial and undisputed in art criticism, because though critics do not clearly connected to beauty, the concept is implied in their criticism. Mothersill's examination of beauty reflects a variation of the method. By the turn of the century we observed the growing of a transformed interest in numerous aspects of beauty. Wilfried Van Damme* explores the anthropological perception of beauty .
<p>
</p>
Eddy M. Zemach supports the objectivity of aesthetic ideas and their practical testability. James Kirwan analyses the history of the notion in order to enlighten the involvement of beauty. Peg Zeglin Brand studies the character and importance of beauty in every day life and in relation to gender. Lorand suggests an idea of aesthetic organization that renews the association of beauty and art, and Nick Zangwill reconsiders the metaphysics of beauty . Many other modern reports confirm and concludes that beauty is central to human kind experience in spite of its neglect in the reasoning of the twentieth century. The genuine significance of beauty is bound to intrigue the thoughtful mind and stimulate further examinations of its nature.
